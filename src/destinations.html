The park, created in partnership with the local Anishinabe First Nation communities of Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg and the Algonquins of Pikwakanagan, celebrates Indigenous culture and heritage in the capital region. On-site there are interpretive panels with text in Algonquin, English and French as well as colorful illustrations depicting the Anishinaabe interacting with land, water, air and people. There are also large steel animal silhouettes of a moose, black bear, river otter, eagle and turtle, created by Sylvia Tennisco based on artwork by Tony Amikons who both live in the Pikwakanagan First Nation community.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Northern Manitoba is in the sub-Arctic Circle bordering Hudson Bay. Up here, you'll find Churchill, which bills itself as “one of the top three places on the planet” to see the Lights. In fact, scientists from around the globe flock to the town of nearly 900, famed for polar bears, to study the aurora. But the thing that makes a visit even more special is that you can combine it with bucket list wildlife viewing — think belugas, polar bears, Arctic foxes, and more. Via Winnipeg is the best route, pausing at the Manitoba Museum to learn more about the Lights and how best to photograph them. Late winter – Aurora high season in Churchill is February and March because of the extreme cold, which can drop to 40 below zero. Go with experienced operator Frontiers North, heading out around midnight in a heated Tundra Buggy kitted out with a bar.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Ivvavik National Park is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. In this Arctic national park, you’ll come across cultural sites dating back over 9,000 years, abundant wildlife (Ivvavik means “a place for giving birth, a nursery” in the language of the Inuvialuit) and pristine wilderness that sees only a few lucky visitors each year. One of the best ways to experience this park is on a multi-day rafting trip (no experience required) down the Firth River. With 24 hours of daylight in summertime, this paddling trip offers plenty of opportunities for hiking and fishing while taking in this land of contrast, from rugged mountain peaks to the vast tundra and ice-filled seas.The park bordered by the Arctic Ocean at the northern tip of the Yukon is accessible by chartered plane from Innuvik, via Edmonton, Whitehorse, Yellowknife.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Pick up some firewood and marshmallows on your way to the campfire-friendly Middle Cove Beach, one of Canada's most dramatic beaches. Fifteen minutes away from St. John's, you'll find yourself at the edge of Canada with cinematic vistas of Atlantic waves that crash into the rocky shoreline on either side of the beach. Come see icebergs lazily float by in the spring or head to the water's edge in the summer to watch the capelin roll, when tens of thousands of fish come to spawn, often with humpback whales not far behind. Finish your day by cozying up to one of the many fire pits dotted along the beach (after reviewing local guidelines on campfire safety, of course). If you prefer to warm up indoors, head to nearby fishing hamlet Quidi Vidi for some fresh seafood and charming maritime hospitality at Mallard Cottage, a restaurant housed in an 18th-century Irish-Newfoundland cottage.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Approximately 100 kilometres off the northern coast of British Columbia, you’ll find the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve. The reserve — which covers close to 1,500 km2 of land — hosts a diversity of wildlife, from bald eagles to bears and breaching whales. Besides wildlife viewing, there are an array of activities, including peaceful kayak trips, hikes through the temperate rainforest and the chance to be immersed in the culture of the Haida First Nations. Canada is home to 48 national parks, and these are just a few of our favorites. Perfect to explore in all seasons, find more outdoor inspiration on Parks Canada’s website.</p>
